Project 1: This SQL script combines hotel data from the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 into a single dataset using a WITH clause. The consolidated data is then joined with the market_segment$ and meal_cost$ tables to enrich the dataset with market segment details and meal cost information.
Project 2: Hotel Revenue Analysis and Data Enrichment:
This project involves aggregating hotel data from 2018 to 2020 to analyze annual revenue generated by different hotels. Revenue is calculated based on the length of stays and average daily rate (ADR). The data is further enriched by joining with market segment and meal cost tables to provide additional insights into customer demographics and preferences.
